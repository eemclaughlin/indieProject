I went over my project very carefully and I think that, overall, it will show my understanding of industry best practices. I don't think any code is perfect.  I am sure that there are methods that I could break up further and that sort of thing. But, I think that ultimately what we are looking for is for the code to be easy to understand and readable and I believe I have achieved that. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

I greatly improved my documentation in regard to project planning. Also, my project shows that I documented and commented my code very well and I have all javadoc html document generated.  A good example of this is the project plan.  When we started the project I was so overwhelmed that I didn't even know what to put down.  As time went on and my understanding grew, I used the project plan more and more and really began to rely on it for what I should work on next.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

With the exercise and team project, I actually really learned a lot and learned to like building the web services. I would not have expected that when first starting out.  Our team project wasn't perfect but I recognize the flaws and have learned from those mistakes.  One area that I know needed some work was in regard to when to use the path param and when to use the query param which I think I understand better now.                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Between the team project and my owm, I had a lot of branches and had much practice in merging and conflict resolution.  I also learned to ignore files and remove files after they have been uploaded.  Along with that, I really learned a lot regarding markdown(.md) commands and formatting which is also a big part of communicating via GitHub.  I was pretty vigilant with commiting changes often and putting down some relevant data about my changes.

I think that is extra true in regard to programming.  I know that almost every time I look at my code (in this project or others) I see things that I could have done better or differently.  Our code is always evolving and changing as ew grow and learn.  I think that as long we acknowledge that we can always do better and we don't get complacent that we are on the right path. An example of a simple change that made a big difference for me is one related to getting user data from the database.  I had configured several classes and they all were doing the same thing where they were getting one bit of data from cognito and then calling all these methods to get the user data again and again.  Finally it dawned on me that I really on need to get that user data once and then can just send that around instead.  This is a simple example, of course, but one I learned from and my code ended up being a lot cleaner because I took the time to reflect on how to do that better. |

I utilized your guides to break down all the project aspects and reported my findings back to my peers.  I think I did good job at that part.  I very much took the feedback I received to heart and implemented a lot of what was given to me as well.                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
